Assignment 
**********
1. WHat is OOPS?
	-Object-oriented programming (OOP) is nothing but that which allows the writing of programs with the help of certain classes and real-time objects.
	-The primary purpose of the class is to store data and information. The members of a class define the behaviour of the class
		OOP offers code reusability. Already created classes can be reused without having to write them again.
		OOP facilitates the quick development of programs where parallel development of classes is possible.
		With OOP, programs are easier to test, manage and debug.
	
2. Inheritance
	-Inheritance is the ability of one class to inherit capabilities or properties of another class, called the parent class.
	-The class which inherits the properties of other is known as subclass (derived class, child class) and the class whose properties are inherited is known
		as superclass (base class, parent class).
	-extends is the keyword used to inherit the properties of a class
	
3. Composition
	-A composition in Java between two objects associated with each other exists when there is a strong relationship between one class and another. Other classes cannot exist without the owner or parent class. For example, A 'Human' class is a composition of Heart and lungs.
	
4. Encapsulation
	-It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit, e.g., a class in Java
	-Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit. 
	-In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class.
	
5. Data Hiding
	-Data Hiding is acheived through encapsulation
	-In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class. -Therefore, it is also known as data hiding. Declare the variables of a class as private. Provide public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables values.
	
6. Abstraction
	-Abstraction refers to the act of representing important and special features without including the background details or explanation about that feature 
	-In java, abstraction is achieved by interfaces and abstract classes. 
	-We can achieve 100% abstraction using interfaces.
	
7.Polymorphism
	-Polymorphism is the ability of data to be processed in more than one form. It allows the performance of the same task in various ways. 
	-There are two types of polymorphism in java: compile-time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism
	-It consists of method overloading and method overriding
